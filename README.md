## GUI
For now the following functionality is available:
- start the gui with `start_gui`.
- Adding all information.
  - If no informatino is set, standard values are used.
  - Path's are required.
- Run runs the script.
- In order to be able to view the result, the movie must be stored.
- Once the script's did finish a `show result` button will show up that when pressed will open a video view. No additional functionality in the video view for now.
- Not everything is commented out yet.
- GUI design is not final.
- Image views are not connected to code yet.
